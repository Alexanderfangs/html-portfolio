<h2>10 Fangs to our Top 3 movies of all time.</h2>
<hr />
       <h3>Django Unchained 2012</h3>
   <p>An often solemn but hilarious 'black get you back movie' that draws on historical horrors with deep irony. Quentin Tarantino's best work alongside Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs.</p> 
<h3>Casablanca 1942</h3>
<p> Michael Curtiz down to earth romantic drama with old world charm and simplicity. An enduring nod to Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman.</p>
<h3>Good Will Hunting 1997</h3>
<p>The very best of 'unlikely genius' movies with fantastic performances by Matt Damon and Robin Williams, Ben Affleck, Casey Affleck, Minnie Driver and stirling work by Stellan SkarsgƒÅrd.</p>
